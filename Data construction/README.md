## Aim

KHANDLE datasets are released as wide datasets that need to be converted to long datasets. These scripts are to ensure we transpose the data in a uniform way

## Output Variables
1. `STUDYID`
2. `wave`
3. `test`
4. `score`
5. `age`
6. `base_age` (baseline age)
7. `phone_ind2` (indicator for mode of assessment - 1 = phone)
8. `edu` (categorical education)
9. `gender`
10. `race`
11. `age_c` (age centered at 76)
12. `base_age_c` (baseline age centered at 76)
13. `years_since_base` (years since baseline)
14. `first_assess` (indicator for first assessment)
15. `score_z` (z-scored cognitive score using wave 1 mean and SD)
